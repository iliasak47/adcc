# ADCC Historical Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project uses statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical match data from the Abu Dhabi Combat Club (ADCC) competitions. The key objectives are to uncover patterns in match outcomes and athlete performance strategies.

Analysis Techniques
Association Rule Mining: Applied to discover common patterns and relationships within the data, such as prevalent submissions in specific competition conditions (e.g., weight classes or years).

K-Means Clustering: Utilized to segment athletes into clusters based on their performance characteristics, which helps identify distinct strategies used by winners and categorizes athletes by their approach to matches (e.g., aggressive submission seekers vs. strategic point earners).

Insights and Benefits
The analysis provides insights into effective competition strategies and highlights trends in athlete performance across different ADCC events. These findings can assist coaches and athletes in refining their training priorities and competition tactics based on evidence-driven trends from historical data.
